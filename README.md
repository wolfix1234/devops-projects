### DevOps-focused Full-Stack Engineer (Next.js) • Experienced Python developer • Active bug-bounty hunter — curated, production-oriented DevOps examples below for a focused code review.

Note: This repository is a curated sample of selected projects and infrastructure artifacts created specifically for résumé review. It is not a complete listing of my work. Please review the code and configurations carefully — I separated the DevOps content to make a focused evaluation straightforward.

### What you’ll find here

+ A dedicated directory containing the DevOps artifacts for the project I’m working on (Dockerfiles, compose files, Kubernetes manifests, deployment patterns and environment configuration).

+ Examples that demonstrate production-ready approaches for containerized Next.js applications, including a multi-container architecture (dashboard, core, site, MongoDB) and Kubernetes deployment manifests.

+ Focused, pragmatic solutions intended for real-world deployments rather than toy or tutorial examples.

### Why this repo

+ Curated for reviewers: I separated the DevOps work to make it easy for hiring teams to inspect infrastructure, manifests and automation without sifting through unrelated app code.

+ Production intent: The artifacts show how I handle containerization, orchestration, and environment management for scalable Next.js services.

Not exhaustive: I may add other integrations here (payments, object storage buckets, etc.), but the current repo intentionally highlights DevOps concerns only.

+ Security mindset — active bug-bounty hunter

### How to evaluate

each subfolder contains a README explaining purpose and how to run the configs locally or in a cluster that was for the projects.

Inspect Dockerfiles, compose files, and k8s manifests to see decisions about images, healthchecks, pod specs, volumes, and secrets handling.

Review deployment patterns and any automation scripts for CI/CD and rollouts.

If you want a live walkthrough of any component or the full architecture, I’m happy to schedule a short demo.
